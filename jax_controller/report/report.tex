Initial weight parameters was set using Python's random library. The weights were set to a random number within the interval $[0,1)$.


\begin{verbatim}
Training set MSE: 0.0392
Test set MSE: 0.0399
\end{verbatim}

The result above was obtained with a learning rate of 0.001 and 1000 epochs. 

\begin{verbatim}
Training set MSE: 0.0504
Test set MSE: 0.0517
\end{verbatim}

The result above was obtained after setting the amount of epochs to 100 instead of 1000. Still using a learning rate of 0.001.

\begin{verbatim}
Training set MSE: 0.0389
Test set MSE: 0.0383
\end{verbatim}

The best results was obtained with a learning rate of 0.05 and 1000 epochs. Slightly better than a learning rate of
