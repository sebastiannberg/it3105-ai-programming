The initial error is not that high but it quickly goes down within the first 10 epochs. After that it continues
to go down, but at a lower rate. Given more epochs it might go down further. The MSE varies but this might be a response
to the relatively high disturbance range. The parameters change more in the earlier epochs, especially the $K_i$. After about
10 epochs the $K_i$ parameter changes at a lower rate. This is probably reflected in the MSE plot after 10 epochs, as we
can see that the rate of change is lower after that point.

In this run the initial error is higher. This might be because of the random initializing of weights and biases.
We can see that it goes steadily down, but the curve is not that steep. This is because the learning rate in this run is set
to 0.001 instead of 0.01 as in the run with the classic controller above. In particular we observed that the gradients for the
output layer could be high, indicating that these values were far off after initializing them. The controller still manages
to learn, and displays a considerate change in MSE.

The result above was obtained with a learning rate of 0.001 and 1000 epochs. 

\begin{verbatim}
Training set MSE: 0.0504
Test set MSE: 0.0517

The result above was obtained after setting the amount of epochs to 100 instead of 1000. Still using a learning rate of 0.001.

\begin{verbatim}
Training set MSE: 0.0389
Test set MSE: 0.0383

The best results was obtained with a learning rate of 0.05 and 1000 epochs. Slightly better than a learning rate of
0.001

\section*{Population Plant Description}

This plant is based on Lotka-Volterra equations that say something about the oscilation of population
in ecologic systems.
